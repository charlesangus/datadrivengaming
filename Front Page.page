# Welcome to RPG Hard Data!

In designing pen and paper RPGs, it is useful to have access to hard data to ensure the game's model of reality is sensible and gives believable results. To that end, this wiki is designed as a clearinghouse for hard data useful for modeling and checking models of reality in RPGs.

# Help

This wiki is using the "gitit" wiki platform.
What that means for you is pages are edited in the simple and
attractive Pandoc Markdown flavour, rather than the nasty syntax
used by MediaWiki and other wiki software.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
More details on installing and configurating gitit are available
in the [Gitit Userâ€™s Guide]().
