# Welcome to Data-driven Gaming!

In designing pen and paper RPGs, it is useful to have access to hard data 
to ensure the game's model of reality is sensible and gives believable 
results. To that end, this wiki is designed as a clearinghouse for hard 
data useful for modeling and checking models of reality in RPGs.

# Contributing

Please feel free to join in the editing. This project is *very* much a work 
in progress - a first draft, even. You'll be asked to create an account on 
GitHub in order to contribute, or to link your existing account. This is 
because this wiki actually exists as a 
[git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/charlesangus/datadrivengaming).
It also helps me in running the site, because I don't have to worry about logins.

## Principles

Ideally, data should be included here in the wiki. Don't just link to something;
the page could go down, the information could be removed, etc. Obviously, please
don't upload pirated material or otherwise illegal things.
Link to the source, as well.

The wiki is for hard data and analysis of the data.

# Help

This wiki is using the "gitit" wiki platform.
What that means for you is pages are edited in the simple and
attractive Pandoc Markdown flavour, rather than the nasty syntax
used by MediaWiki and other wiki software.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
More details on installing and configurating gitit are available
in the [Gitit Userâ€™s Guide]().
